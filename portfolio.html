        <h3>Project 1 :  Toxic Comment Classification using Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Developed a deep learning model to detect toxic language in online comments using the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset. Employed NLP techniques for preprocessing and built a Bi-directional LSTM model with TensorFlow and Keras to classify multiple types of toxicity. Achieved strong validation performance and deployed the model with a Gradio interface for real-time predictions.</p>
        <h3>Project 2 : Movie Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>Created a hybrid movie recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and content-based methods. Used Scikit-learn and the Surprise library to analyze user preferences and metadata from the TMDb API. Delivered personalized movie suggestions through a user-friendly Streamlit web app.</p>
        <h3>Project 3 : COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard</h3>
        <p>Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize global COVID-19 trends. Integrated real-time data from public APIs, enabling users to explore statistics by country, metric, and date. Included time series plots and heatmaps to support dynamic analysis and data-driven insights.</p>
